# Fake-Data-Generator


We all understand the importance of data. The issue is that we often don't have (enough of) it. We need to test data apps and pipelines using data that is similar to what would be observed in production.

Manually creating realistic datasets of adequate amount and variety is tough (e.g., different data types, characteristics). Hand-created data is also susceptible to our unconscious and systematic biases.

#### Faker 
  - Python package for creating fictitious data. According to the manual, it may be easily installed with the following command: install Faker with pip
We create a Faker class object and call the different methods to generate the sort of mock data we want after it's deployed.

Furthermore, Faker has its own pytest plugin, which provides a faker fixture you can use in your tests.
